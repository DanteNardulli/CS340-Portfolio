How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?
  Writing maintainable, readable, and adaptable programs is essential for long-term project success, especially when collaborating with others or preparing software for real-world use. I was able to accomplish this with clear structure and modularity, the use of naming        conventions, keeping a consistent style, and precise documentation. Creating a crud module allowed me to reuse the code for multiple assignments/projects. As well as update the database connection logic or queries without touching th UI code. This also allowed me to debug   and test the database functions independentaly from the dashboard. This CRUD module could be adapted for other projects that need to interact with a MongoDB database. By changing only the connection string or schema details, I could quickly support other applications such   as client management systems, inventory systems, or even new dashboards for other clients.
  
How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?
  As a computer scientist I approach problems methodically. It is important to understand the requirements, break down the problem, followed by designing the code first, and then building it. In earlier classes, assignments were often isolated tasks: solving a specific        algorithm problem or creating a single program. In this project, I had to integrate multiple technologies (MongoDB, Dash, Plotly) and think about system design, scalability, and user experience more like real-world development. 

What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?
  Computer scientists solve problems by designing, building, and maintaining software systems that are efficient, scalable, and reliable. Our work enables companies, non-profits, and individuals to make smarter decisions, work more efficiently, and improve services. By        building a dashboard tied directly to their animal shelter database, I gave Grazioso Salvare the ability to quickly locate dogs suited for specific rescue operations. Visualize and interact with real-time data without needing technical expertise. Make faster, more           informed decisions about dog training and deployment. Ultimately, this helps Grazioso Salvare save more lives by efficiently selecting and training the right dogs for rescue missions.
